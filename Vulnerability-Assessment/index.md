🔐 Debian SSH Vulnerability Assessment (Lab Project)

📌 Project Overview
This project documents a vulnerability assessment performed against a Debian Linux virtual machine using Nmap from a Kali Linux attacker machine.
The goal was to identify exposed services, enumerate service versions, and detect known vulnerabilities using NSE vulnerability scripts.

🛠 Tools Used


Nmap


Nmap NSE Scripts


Vulners Script


VirtualBox



🚀 Scan Command Used
sudo nmap -p- --script vuln 10.0.2.4 -oN vuln_report.txt


🔎 Scan Findings Summary

1️⃣ Open Ports Identified
PortServiceVersion22/tcpSSHOpenSSH 9.2p1 Debian

2️⃣ Detected Vulnerabilities
The vulners NSE script identified multiple CVEs associated with the detected OpenSSH version.


Multiple CVEs with CVSS scores up to 8.1


Exploit references available in public repositories


Version-based vulnerability matching


⚠️ Note: Nmap vulnerability detection is version-based and may include false positives.

🎯 Risk Analysis
Exposed SSH service presents:


Potential remote exploitation risk


Brute-force attack surface


Credential-based attack exposure


Public exploit references available


If the system is internet-facing, risk level increases significantly.

🛡 Recommended Mitigations


Disable SSH if not required


Change default SSH port


Implement key-based authentication


Disable root login


Configure firewall (UFW)


Enable Fail2Ban


Keep system updated


sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
