🛡 Windows Host Vulnerability Assessment – Nessus

📌 Project Overview

This project documents a vulnerability assessment performed on a Windows host using Nessus Essentials.

The objective was to identify security misconfigurations, analyze risk severity, and implement remediation controls following a structured vulnerability management workflow.

🎯 Objectives

Perform authenticated vulnerability scan on a Windows system

Identify and categorize vulnerabilities by severity

Analyze security impact and attack vectors

Apply remediation controls

Validate fixes through rescan

🔍 Key Findings

The scan identified:

1 Medium Severity Vulnerability

Multiple informational findings related to system services and configurations

Highlighted Vulnerability:

SMB Signing Not Required (Medium Risk)

This misconfiguration allows potential man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, where an attacker on the same network could intercept or manipulate SMB traffic.

🛠 Remediation Implemented

To mitigate the vulnerability:

Enabled SMB signing via Windows Group Policy

Enforced digital signing of SMB communications

Conducted a validation rescan to confirm remediation

🔁 Validation Process

After remediation, a rescan was performed to confirm:

SMB signing enforcement was successfully applied

No medium-severity vulnerability remained
