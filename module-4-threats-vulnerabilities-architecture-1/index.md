# Module 4: Threats, Vulnerabilities & Architecture I

## Objective
To understand common cybersecurity threats, system vulnerabilities, and how secure architecture helps reduce security risks.

## Key Concepts Covered
- Types of cyber threats (malware, phishing, insider threats)
- Vulnerabilities and risk exposure
- Threat actors and attack vectors
- Secure system and network architecture
- Defense-in-depth principle

## What I Learned
- Threats are potential causes of security incidents
- Vulnerabilities are weaknesses that attackers exploit
- Not all threats are technical; human factors are also critical
- Secure architecture helps limit attack surfaces
- Defense-in-depth improves overall system security

## Real-World Relevance
Organizations use secure architectures and vulnerability management to reduce the impact of cyberattacks and protect critical assets.

## Summary
This module provided insight into how threats and vulnerabilities affect systems and how proper architecture design plays a key role in cybersecurity defense.
